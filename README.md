Run the json server before starting the application using the following command

To run the react application

The application was first implemented using redux-thunk as a middleware then it had to be changed to redux-saga. However, the codes for redux-thunk are there in a separate folder.
# React + redux-Thunk and React + redux-saga

As for styling, used three different methods in different parts of the application
# css
# Styled-System: rebass
# react emotions
